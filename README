Hebreu
======

I'm learning hebrew, this project creates a french/hebreuw booklet for
my homeworks, it includes vocabulary, grammar, etc. It will get bigger
as I'm advancing in the language.

Maybe the content will interest only me, but the tools (XeLaTeX,
psutils) and process I use to print the booklet in a right to left
script may be useful for others.

Dependencies
============

- Make
- XeLaTeX, with geometry, fontspec, bidi packages
- psutils
- ConTeXt (only for pstopdf utility)
- croscore fonts

On Debian, `apt-get install texlive-full psutils fonts-croscore`
should do the trick.

Usage
=====
create the booklet `livret.pdf`:

    make

clean everything

    make clean

You should print `livret.pdf` with print option two-sided : short edge
(flip).
